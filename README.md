## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **EJS**: A templating engine used for generating HTML with embedded JavaScript.
